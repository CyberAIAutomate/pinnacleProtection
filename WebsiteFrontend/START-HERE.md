## 💡 MY RECOMMENDATION

Based on modern web trends and the security industry:

### **I Recommend VERSION 2 (Dark Theme)** because:

1. ✅ **Modern appeal** - Attracts contemporary clients
2. ✅ **Stands out** - Different from typical security sites
3. ✅ **High contrast** - CTAs are more visible
4. ✅ **Premium feel** - Supports higher pricing
5. ✅ **Bold messaging** - Matches your "Active Protection" USP
6. ✅ **Competitive edge** - Looks more expensive/professional

**BUT** Version 1 is excellent too! It depends on your target market:
- **Government/corporate clients?** → Version 1
- **Modern businesses/properties?** → Version 2
- **Conservative market?** → Version 1
- **Urban/competitive market?** → Version 2
