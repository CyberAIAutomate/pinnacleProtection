## 🏆 MY RECOMMENDATION

Based on the security industry analysis and modern web trends:

2. ✅ **Modern appeal** attracts younger decision-makers
3. ✅ **High contrast** makes CTAs more visible
4. ✅ **Bold messaging** matches "Active Protection" USP
5. ✅ **Premium feel** supports higher pricing
6. ✅ **Urban markets** (Saskatoon) prefer modern design
7. ✅ **Competitive advantage** - looks more expensive
8. ✅ **Mobile performance** - slightly faster loading

**BUT keep Version 1 as backup** for:
- Government/corporate pitches
- Conservative client presentations
- Testing/comparison purposes
