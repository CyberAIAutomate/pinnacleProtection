<form id="contactForm" action="https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_FORM_ID" method="POST">
```

```html
<form name="contact" method="POST" data-netlify="true">
```
2. Forms submissions appear in Netlify dashboard
3. Set up email notifications in settings

#### Option 3: Custom Backend
Create a PHP script (`process-form.php`):
```php
<?php
if ($_SERVER["REQUEST_METHOD"] == "POST") {
    $to = "Pinnacle4protection@gmail.com";
    $subject = "New Quote Request from Website";
    
    $firstName = $_POST['firstName'];
    $lastName = $_POST['lastName'];
    $email = $_POST['email'];
    $phone = $_POST['phone'];
    $service = $_POST['service'];
    $message = $_POST['message'];
    
    $body = "New quote request:\n\n";
    $body .= "Name: $firstName $lastName\n";
    $body .= "Email: $email\n";
    $body .= "Phone: $phone\n";
    $body .= "Service: $service\n";
    $body .= "Message:\n$message\n";
    
    mail($to, $subject, $body);
    header("Location: thank-you.html");
}
?>
```

Update form in `index.html`:

```
